## Hey there 👋 I’m Riley

I am a 16 year old developer and I have been very interested in programming since the beginning of high school. I've been working on small projects as part of school curriculums and pure enjoyment for CS. I am starting my Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming) at North Metropolitan TAFE in Perth, Western Australia.
